Title: Feature Selection for Multivariate Time Series
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Dmitry Pavlyuk
Maintainer: Dmitry Pavlyuk <Dmitry.Pavlyuk@tsi.lv>
Description: Implements feature selection routines for multivariate time series (MTS). 
    The list of implemented methods includes: 
    own lags (independent MTS components), 
    distance-based (using external structure),
    cross-correlation-based,
    graphical LASSO-based,
    random forest-based,
    least angle regression-based, 
    and mutual information-based. 
    In addition, the package implements functions for ensemble feature selection (using feature ranking and majority voting).
    The package is implemented within Dmitry Pavlyuk's research project No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/112 "Spatiotemporal urban traffic modelling using big data".
